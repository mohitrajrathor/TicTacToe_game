# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Play

2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python:

```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
5. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- Tracks player turns and announces the winner.
- Handles invalid moves and prevents players from overwriting existing marks.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on an empty cell of the 3x3 grid.
- The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their marks wins the game.
- If all cells are filled without any player forming a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
